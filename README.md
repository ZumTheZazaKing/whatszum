# WhatsZum
A chat app for the world. Why? Well...it's because it's available to the public and whatnot..

### Why did I make this?
Well, basically, a few months ago I did this super chat where anyone could converse with one another on the same channel. So I thought, why not try do private channels instead? Since I had no idea on what to do at the time (a.k.a bored), I decided to take the challenge.

### Did I face any challenges
Yes, I did. But all's well, ends well. I managed to somehow surpass the difficulties and succeeded in making it, although it is missing most of the features a normal chat app would have. Either way, I'm just doing it for fun so it's complete when I say it's complete.

By the way, it took some time for me to make this due to travelling and **some** procrastination.

### What does it do?
I don't think I really need to elaborate on that do I? Unless you're retarded. I'll say it once again, it's a chat app.

## Technologies I used
-   React (Front-end)
-   Firebase (Back-end)
-   Netlify (Deployment)

**The reason I chose React for front-end**  is because it offers a lot of packages which I can use to ease the development of this app. I also chose React because I like it. Oh! By the way, I used  **CRA**  to get things started

**The reason I chose Firebase for back-end**  is because I wouldn't have to bother myself with back-end stuff for I am more of a front-end developer. It gets all the hard work done and it can easily be integrated with React. It's also free to use, within a certain quota that is.

**The reason I chose Netlify for deployment**  is because it can deploy React apps with ease and this app is more to front-end than back-end so  **Heroku**  was crossed out.

### Future Features
I might add image sharing and that thing where the chat you received the most recent message gets moved to the top. That is, if I decide to maintain this and the chances of that are incredibly low.

# Conclusion
This is a personal project and was made for fun. Feel free to criticise my work in any way you see fit.
